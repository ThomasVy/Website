I was conflicted on what to do; do I follow the difficult path of Engineering or do I stay in the degree that I didn't find appealing. After talking to some friends on what to do, they convinced me to try out Electrical Engineering instead. What really convinced me to transfer to Electrical Engineering was that a super close friend of mine was also switching into Engineering and he had the knowledge for switching from a science major to an engineering major. I knew that the average to get into Engineering was high (near a 3.60 GPA) and there was a chance I would be wasting my time trying to switch, but I had to try. For the remainder of the semester and the next semester, I studied hard. After all the hard work, I was successfully able to enter Electrical Engineering. I was scared. I've heard the horror stories about individuals failing Engineering and forced to drop out of university, and I was now a full year behind all my highschool friends that entered university at the same time as me. Luckily, I still had that one friend that helped me transfer into Engineering.

I was thinking that my choice would remain Electrical Engineering, however, in my first semester of Engineering, I had a programming class called ",Object(v.jsx)("a",{href:"http://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/enel/courses/f18/ENGG233",children:"ENGG 233 "}),"where we learned Processing (a language mixed between Java/Arduino). That class taught me the fundamentals of programming and taught me how fun programming was. I had no prior experience with programming before that class, but after taking that course I immediately fell in love with programming. Programming in that class gave me a sense of euphoria whenever my code worked (Always made me want to dance). I created this billiard game as a final project in that class (you can find it on my ",Object(v.jsx)("a",{href:"https://github.com/ThomasVy",children:"GitHub"}),"), and when I got something to finally work after many failed attempts, it was one of the best feelings that I ever had. When I handed in the game for the class, I was extremely happy that I could product a game like that out of scratch, but I was also sad that the coding class was over. That's when I started asking myself, if I still wanted to be register for Electrical Engineering. I waited for next semester to begin before making that decision, we had an actual electrical engineering class the next semester. In that class, I never had the same excitement as making something work with code (in fact, I was actually underwhelmed when things started to work). I was lost on what to do. This is when I consulted my good friend that helped me transfer in to Engineering. After explaining my situation, he told me go for the path that made me feel the most achieved, Software Engineering. That was when I decided I wanted to do Software Engineering. That was in fall 2016 when Software Engineering was the most undesired Engineering specialization, and now it is the most sought-after Engineering specialization. Sometimes, I do wish that I would've taken a more direct route programming, taken a degree in Computer Science instead of Software Engineering.
